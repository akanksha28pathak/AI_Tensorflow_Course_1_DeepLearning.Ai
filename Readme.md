# Understanding neural network with Tensorflow


- house_price_prediction.py- The first assignment is a "Hello World " assignment for Neural Network
wherein, we fit a linear regression equation, with few examples.
Play with the code by adding more values of x and y and observe the change in accuracy.

-MNIST_digit_callback.py- This assignment shows the usage of callbacks in Tensorflow. A 2-layer dense-layer neural network
is used to classify MNIST digits. Check other keys of 'history' of model such as 'loss', to implement callback.
