# Understanding neural network with Tensorflow


- house_price_prediction.py- The first assignment is a "Hello World " assignment for Neural Network
wherein, we fit a linear regression equation, with few examples.
Play with the code by adding more values of x and y and observe the change in accuracy.

- MNIST_digit_callback.py- This assignment shows the usage of callbacks in Tensorflow. A 2-layer dense-layer neural network
is used to classify MNIST digits. Check other keys of 'history' of model such as 'loss', to implement callback.

- MNIST_digit_CNN.py- This assignment shows the usage of single Convolution layer and a maxpool layer for classification. A callback
function is also implemented to stop the training. Check out performance, training time, model parameters by varying number of filters in 
convolution layer. Also observe the variation by changing the filter size.
